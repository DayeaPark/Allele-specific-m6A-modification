### Transcriptome-specific VCF and masked transcriptome for ASM analysis

In this research, we utilized hybrid mouse embryonic stem cells (mESC, C57BL/6J x CAST/EiJ) and the human NA12878 cell line for ASM analysis. Esch directory contains essential reference files for this analysis: masked transcriptome reference (FASTA), transcript annotations (GTF), and genetic VCF files.
