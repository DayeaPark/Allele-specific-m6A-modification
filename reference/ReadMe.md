# Generating transcriptome-specific VCF and masked transcriptome for ASM analysis
For ASM analysis, a modified transcriptome and a VCF file, with location conversion from genome to transcriptome, are required. The custom Python script selects heterozygous SNPs to generate a transcriptome-specific VCF and creates a masked transcriptome in .fa format.
